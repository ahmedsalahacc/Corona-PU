# Corona-PU
Corona PU is a project that is made to integrate so many technologies with the a goal to design, and create a computer from scratch, but unlike other computers, we are making a computer that is actually built over Xilinx simulator and running our simulations on that computer, as it has its own compiler for its own instruction set (BEMO) that is used as an instruction set to deal with the computer.
All components was made using VHDL
All computer components have been used and rendered in Xilinx simulator using ower computer
3D models have been created and tested on the computer using BEMO instruction set.
A game has been created and implemented, and AI have been made to play this game.
you can read the documentaions accompanied by the project to fully understand how this project was created
