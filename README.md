# Corona-PU
Corona PU is a project that is made to integrate so many technologies with the a goal to design, and create a computer from scratch, but unlike other computers, we are making a computer that is actually built over Xilinx simulator and running our simulations on that computer, as it has its own compiler for its own instruction set (BEMO) that is used as an instruction set to deal with the computer.
* All components were made using VHDL
* All computer components have been used and tested in Xilinx simulator using ower computer
* The game made was made using BEMO (our instruction set) and runs on our computer
* 3D models have been created and run on our computer using BEMO instruction set.
* A game has been created and implemented, and AI have been made to play this game using BEMO (our instruction set).
