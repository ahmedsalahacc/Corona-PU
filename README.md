# Corona-PU
Corona PU is a designed, and created computer from scratch, but unlike other computers, we made a computer that is actually built over Xilinx simulator. We also ran our simulations, and RL-Training on our computer. The PU has its own compiler for its own instruction set (BEMO) that is used as an instruction set to deal with the computer.
* All components were made using VHDL
* All computer components have been used and tested in Xilinx simulator using our computer
* The game made was made using BEMO (our instruction set) and runs on our computer
* 3D models have been created and run on our computer using BEMO instruction set.
* A game has been created and implemented, and AI have been made to play this game using BEMO (our instruction set).
